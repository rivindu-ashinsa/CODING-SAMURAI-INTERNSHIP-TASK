## 📌 Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

### 🎯 Objective
Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to understand feature distributions, identify trends, and visualize relationships.

### ✅ Key Highlights
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values in `Age` and `Embarked`, and dropping sparse features like `Cabin`.
- Utilized **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to create histograms, bar plots, and heatmaps.
- Identified critical insights such as:
  - Higher survival rates for females.
  - First-class passengers had a better chance of survival.
  - Age and fare played moderate roles in predicting survival.

### 🛠️ Skills & Tools Used
- `Pandas`, `NumPy`
- `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`
- Data Wrangling & Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Statistical Analysis

## 📌 Project 2: Logistic Regression - Predicting Titanic Survival

### 🎯 Objective
Build and evaluate a logistic regression classification model to predict survival on the Titanic based on key passenger attributes.

### ✅ Key Highlights
- Preprocessed the data using encoding and standardization (`LabelEncoder`, `StandardScaler`).
- Built a classification model using **Scikit-learn's LogisticRegression**.
- Evaluated the model with:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score (via Classification Report)
- Gained insight into the predictive importance of features like `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Fare`.

### 🛠️ Skills & Tools Used
- `Scikit-learn`
- Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation
- Feature Engineering
- Classification Techniques
